00:00:17,124 --> 00:00:20,212
Okay, this first unit we&#39;ll talk about the alphabet

1
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:23,297
and how to pronounce German words.

2
00:00:23,297 --> 00:00:25,345
We&#39;ll cover personal pronouns,

3
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:28,241
and in German we have formal vs. informal

4
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:31,121
way of addressing people.

5
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:34,177
And the last part of the first unit

6
00:00:34,177 --> 00:00:38,344
is sein and haben, the auxiliaries to be and to have,

7
00:00:39,184 --> 00:00:41,072
and we&#39;ll learn how to conjugate those

8
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,822
in the present tense.

9
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:48,880
We&#39;ll talk some more about greetings and introductions.

10
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,119
And we always finish with jetzt Ã¼ben wir,

11
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,619
which is the practice session.
